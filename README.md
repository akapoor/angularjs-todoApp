## Requirements
To avoid any tooling or build script requirements for this project, it is assumed
this project will be run as-is directly from the file system. AJAX requests do not
work in this environment, so everything must be loaded with `<script>` tags.

[Template literal strings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Template_literals)
are utilized for templates. Therefore, be sure to use a [compatible browser](https://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/#test-template_strings).
